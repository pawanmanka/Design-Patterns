Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

✅ Key Points
private __construct() prevents creating a new instance via new.

private __clone() prevents cloning the instance.

__wakeup() throws an error to prevent restoring an instance from serialization.

getInstance() creates or returns the existing instance.

✅ When to Use
Logger classes

Database connection managers

Redis connection

Configuration access

Caching systems



In Laravel, the best way to implement a singleton is via service container binding. Laravel handles most core services like logging, cache, Redis, DB, and filesystem as singletons by default.
