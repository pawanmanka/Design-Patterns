The Prototype Design Pattern in PHP is a creational pattern used when you want to clone objects instead of creating new instances from scratch â€” especially when object creation is expensive or complex.

ðŸ§  Why Use Prototype Pattern?
To avoid costly creation of new objects (e.g. database calls, heavy setup)

To create copies of existing objects with slight modifications

To use a shared "template" object that can be cloned

âœ… Key Concept
In PHP, this is achieved using the clone keyword.



ðŸ§© Advanced Use: Deep Copying
If your object has nested objects or arrays, you may need to implement __clone() to handle deep copying.


class Profile {
    public $bio;
}

class User {
    public $name;
    public $profile;

    public function __construct($name, $bio) {
        $this->name = $name;
        $this->profile = new Profile();
        $this->profile->bio = $bio;
    }

    public function __clone() {
        $this->profile = clone $this->profile;
    }
}


âœ… Summary
Feature	Description
clone keyword	Creates a shallow copy of the object
__clone()	Customize deep copy behavior
Use case	Duplicate objects without reinitializing
