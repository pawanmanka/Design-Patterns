The Prototype Design Pattern in PHP is a creational pattern used when you want to clone objects instead of creating new instances from scratch â€” especially when object creation is expensive or complex.

ðŸ§  Why Use Prototype Pattern?
To avoid costly creation of new objects (e.g. database calls, heavy setup)

To create copies of existing objects with slight modifications

To use a shared "template" object that can be cloned

âœ… Key Concept
In PHP, this is achieved using the clone keyword.
