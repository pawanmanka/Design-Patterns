**ðŸ”Œ Adapter Pattern in PHP**
The Adapter Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping an existing class with a new interface.

**ðŸ§  Real-World Analogy**
Imagine you have a phone charger with a USB plug, but the wall socket only accepts a Type-C. You need an adapter to convert the plug.

**âœ… When to Use It in PHP**
- You want to reuse a class that doesnâ€™t match the required interface.
- Youâ€™re integrating third-party APIs or legacy code.
- You want to create a bridge between two incompatible interfaces.


ðŸ“¦ PHP Example: Basic Adapter
Scenario:
You have an old payment gateway and a new system expects a different method name.

ðŸ§¾ Old Payment Gateway
```php 
class OldPaymentGateway {
    public function makePayment($amount) {
        echo "Paid $amount using Old Gateway.";
    }
}

```

ðŸ†• New Interface

```php
interface PaymentGatewayInterface {
    public function pay($amount);
}

```

ðŸ”§ Adapter

```php 
class PaymentAdapter implements PaymentGatewayInterface {
    protected $oldGateway;

    public function __construct(OldPaymentGateway $oldGateway) {
        $this->oldGateway = $oldGateway;
    }

    public function pay($amount) {
        $this->oldGateway->makePayment($amount); // Adapts method call
    }
}

```

âœ… Client Code

```php 
function processPayment(PaymentGatewayInterface $gateway, $amount) {
    $gateway->pay($amount);
}

$oldGateway = new OldPaymentGateway();
$adapter = new PaymentAdapter($oldGateway);

processPayment($adapter, 100);
// Output: Paid 100 using Old Gateway.

```

**ðŸ§© Key Benefits**

| Feature       | Benefit                                       |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| âœ… Reusability | You can reuse legacy or third-party classes   |
| âœ… Decoupling  | Client code depends only on the new interface |
| âœ… Flexibility | Swap in new adapters with ease                |


**ðŸ§© Example 1: Legacy Notification System**

ðŸ›‘ Problem:

You have a legacy email system, but your app expects a unified NotificationInterface for all notifications.


ðŸŽ¯ Target Interface

```php
interface NotificationInterface {
    public function send($to, $message);
}

```

ðŸ§“ Legacy Email Class

```php
class LegacyEmail {
    public function sendEmailTo($emailAddress, $emailBody) {
        echo "Sending email to $emailAddress: $emailBody\n";
    }
}

```


#ðŸ”§ Adapter
```php
class EmailAdapter implements NotificationInterface {
    protected $legacyEmail;

    public function __construct(LegacyEmail $legacyEmail) {
        $this->legacyEmail = $legacyEmail;
    }

    public function send($to, $message) {
        $this->legacyEmail->sendEmailTo($to, $message);
    }
}

```

**âœ… Client Code**

```php
function notifyUser(NotificationInterface $notifier) {
    $notifier->send('user@example.com', 'Welcome!');
}

$legacyEmail = new LegacyEmail();
$adapter = new EmailAdapter($legacyEmail);

notifyUser($adapter);
// Output: Sending email to user@example.com: Welcome!

```
