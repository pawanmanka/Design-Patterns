**🔁 Roadmap: Advanced OOP in PHP (Project-Based)**

**✅ Phase 1: Refactor & Reinforce OOP Foundations***

Goal: Master SOLID, dependency injection, and design patterns in real code.

🔨 Project Idea: "Task Management API"
Build a Laravel (or vanilla PHP) RESTful API for managing tasks with categories, deadlines, and notifications.

Key Goals:

Create Entities (Task, Category) using value objects (e.g., TaskId, DueDate)

Use Repositories + Interfaces for data access

Apply Dependency Injection instead of new inside classes

Follow SOLID principles throughout

🎯 Bonus: Add a NotificationService using the Strategy pattern (email, SMS, etc.)

#

**✅ Phase 2: Composer Package Creation**
Goal: Learn namespacing, autoloading (PSR-4), packaging, and dependency management.

🔨 Project Idea: string-utils Composer Package
Key Features:

Create a StringHelper class (or static proxy)

Add methods like slugify(), truncate(), camelCase(), etc.

Use traits to separate concerns (e.g., StringSanitizer, StringFormatter)

Follow PSR standards

Add unit tests with PHPUnit

Publish to Packagist

🎯 Bonus: Use PHP's Reflection API to auto-discover helper methods.

#

**✅ Phase 3: Deep Dive into Design Patterns**
Goal: Implement real-world design patterns in a modular project.

🔨 Project Idea: "E-Commerce Cart System"
Apply Patterns:

Factory Pattern for creating different Product types

Strategy Pattern for discounts

Observer Pattern for stock and order notifications

Decorator Pattern for optional product features (e.g., gift wrapping)

State Pattern for order status lifecycle

🎯 Bonus: Extract cart logic into a reusable Composer package.

#

**✅ Phase 4: Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**
Goal: Learn DDD through code and model real business logic clearly.

🔨 Project Idea: "Booking System for Appointments"
Modules:

Entity: Appointment, User, Calendar

Value Objects: AppointmentTime, UserId

Domain Services: AppointmentAvailabilityChecker

Application Layer: Handles use cases like BookAppointment, CancelAppointment

Infrastructure Layer: File or DB-based persistence (Repository pattern)

Use:

Interfaces for domain boundaries

Events for domain activities (e.g., appointment booked)

🎯 Bonus: Add Event Sourcing pattern for historical state tracking.

#

**✅ Phase 5: Laravel-Level Architecture Mastery**
Goal: Learn service providers, container bindings, contracts, macroable traits, and more.

🔨 Project Idea: "Multi-Tenant CRM System"
Use Service Providers to register services

Create custom bindings in Laravel’s Service Container

Define Contracts and bind implementations

Use Macros to extend core classes like Collection or Request

Create custom Facades for internal tools

🎯 Bonus: Turn tenant logic into a separate Laravel package.

**🔁 Practice Flow**
| Week | Activity                                                |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1–2  | Refactor existing project to be SOLID-compliant         |
| 3–4  | Build and publish a small Composer package              |
| 5–6  | Implement 3–5 design patterns in a modular project      |
| 7–8  | Model a real-world app using DDD principles             |
| 9–10 | Deep dive into Laravel internals & package architecture |


**🔧 Tools & Tech Stack to Use**
Laravel or Slim (for API structure)

Composer (obviously)

PHPUnit or Pest for testing

PHPStan or Psalm (static analysis)

Git + Packagist (for package publishing)
