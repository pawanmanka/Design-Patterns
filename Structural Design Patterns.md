Structural design patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.


**ðŸ§± Structural Design Patterns in Software Design**
Structural design patterns focus on how objects and classes are composed to form larger structures while keeping the system flexible and efficient. They help ensure that components fit together correctly and maintainable relationships between entities.

**ðŸ”— List of Common Structural Design Patterns**

| Pattern      | Purpose                                                |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1. Adapter   | Converts one interface into another                    |
| 2. Bridge    | Separates abstraction from implementation              |
| 3. Composite | Treats individual objects and compositions uniformly   |
| 4. Decorator | Adds behavior to objects dynamically                   |
| 5. Facade    | Simplifies complex subsystems with a single interface  |
| 6. Flyweight | Shares common parts of objects to save memory          |
| 7. Proxy     | Provides a placeholder or surrogate for another object |
