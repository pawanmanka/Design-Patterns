The Builder Design Pattern in JavaScript helps construct complex objects step-by-step using a fluent and flexible interface, instead of relying on large constructors with many parameters.



âœ… Use Case Example: Building a User Object
ðŸ’¡ When to use:
When an object has many optional properties

When you want a clean, fluent API to construct objects

To separate object construction from its representation



âœ… Benefits
Cleaner alternative to long constructors

Allows immutable/final objects after build

Improves code readability and testability
